COUNT: Count the number of data is available in DB
DISTINCT: avoid redunndancy in select.

Ex: 

select mara~matnr, mard~lgort,
       COUNT(DISTINCT (MARD~MATNR) ) as distinct_matnr,
       COUNT(DISTINCT (MARD~WERKS) ) as distinct_werks,
       SUM(MARD~LABST) as sum_unrest,
       AVG(MARD~INSME) as avg_qlt_insp
       from mara as mara
            mard as mard
      on mara~matnr = mard~matnr

      into table @data(it_data)
      where mara~matnr = '000000000000000012' and 
            mard-lgort = @p_lgort
      group by mara~matnr
               mard~lgort.

Note: When using the aggregate,all the fields which are not part of aggregate functions have to be grouped by,
