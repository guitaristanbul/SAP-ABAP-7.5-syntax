COUNT: Count the number of data is available in DB
DISTINCT: avoid redunndancy in select.

Ex: 

select mara~matnr, mard~lgort,
       COUNT(DISTINCT (MARD~MATNR) ) as distinct_matnr,
       COUNT(DISTINCT (MARD~WERKS) ) as distinct_werks,
       SUM(MARD~LABST) as sum_unrest,
       AVG(MARD~INSME) as avg_qlt_insp
       from mara as mara
            mard as mard
      on mara~matnr = mard~matnr

      into table @data(it_data)
      where mara~matnr = '000000000000000012' and 
            mard-lgort = @p_lgort
      group by mara~matnr
               mard~lgort.

Note: When using the aggregate,all the fields which are not part of aggregate functions have to be grouped by,

2. using literals/using system varaibles are in liteals
   select ebeln,
          10 as num_lit,
          'sat' as string_lit,
          @sy-langu as syst_lang,
          @sy-uname as sys_uname,
          from ekko
           wher ebeln = '000000000000123456'
              into table @data(lt_Data).

3. USING: CEIL/FLOOR/ROUND:
       data : lv_rebat type p decimals 2 value '0.10'. 
       select ebeln
              ( ceil( netpr ) * @lv_Rebate ) as ceil_col,
              floor( netpr ) as floor_col,
              ( @lv_rebate * ntepr ) as rebate,
              ( netpr - ( @lv_Rebate * netpr ) ) as act_net
              from ekpo
              where ebeln = '4500000046'
              into table @data(it_data).
