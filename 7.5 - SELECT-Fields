New syntax - 7.5
1. added the FIELDS keyword in the select statement.
2. always use the -INTO Clause at last of the select statement,

Ex: select from ekpo
          fields ebeln, ebelp, werks, netpr
          CASE when netpr > 100
                  then 'High Value'
               else 'Low Value'
          end as pur_type
          into table @data(it_data).
   use of FIELDS: 1. increase the readability of the code 
                  2. to get the all the field names/fuzy search(CTRL + SPACE ) will work in select statement --> previous version no fuzzy search on select.
   INTO clause - given in last only accepting , because SAP has given in 7.5 introduced UNION/UNION ALL and 
                 these keywords are not possible to use the with in the select and also use it after the INTO claus only.
                even where consition also not accept after the into clause, where condition use before the INTO caluse only.
