Difference between field symbol and Reference Var.?
Reference Variable:
___________________
Ex: data lv_ref_i type ref to i. 
    --> it does, creates the memory in application layer and lv_REf_i is pointing to the perticular memory.

i want to initialize the reference var, use below statement in old
    --> create data lv_Ref_i. --> now lv_Ref_i -- initialize with the value of i means it is 0.
    --> in memory stores the initial value.

how to access the memory value in abap?
    --> using the dereference operator ->*, after dereferencing whatever the value available at particular memory location 
        which is deferencing with the perticular memory.  

data lv_ref_i type ref to i.

create data lv_REf_i.

write : lv_REf_i->*.   --> 0.


Field-Symbols:
_____________

 ---- Field-symbols always point to the value only but not the memoery address.
 ---- it is pointings the memory loction of the value.
 ---- not required de=reference, bcz it is pointing to the perticular memory location of the value.
 ---- it is pointing to the any memory location, any variable and any data reference varibale.


Ex: 
data lv_ref_ type ref to i.

create data lv_Ref_i.

write: lv_Ref_i->* 

assign lv_Ref_i->* to field-symbol(<fs>).

write: <fs>.

data lv_Var type i.

assign lv_var to <fs>.
